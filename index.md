## Aarna Maheshwari's First CS193 Homework

Some of my favorite things abt CS193 :

- My CS193 class ends in the evening which makes for a nice walk back in pleasant weather.
- The quizzes at the end of the class are pretty quirky and I have fun taking them.
- The teachers for CS193 are also students like me which makes it a lot easier to approach them when struggling with something.
- Some of my friends also attend the same 193 class as me so I already know people from my class despite only starting the semester recently.
- The class timing allows me to have a meal before the class so I don't get hungry during class.
